For ? > 2, the longest shared secret that can be established from a tuple of strings (x1, ?, x?) by ? parties?each one having one component of the tuple and the complexity profile of the tuple?is equal, up to logarithmic precision, to the complexity of the tuple minus the minimum communication necessary for distributing the tuple to all parties. We establish the communication complexity of secret key agreement protocols that produce a secret key of maximal length for protocols with public randomness. We also show that if the communication complexity drops below the established threshold, then only very short secret keys can be obtained.},

	abstract = {Finding vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for global pandemic of virus diseases (such as the ongoing COVID-19) requires rapid analysis, annotation and evaluation of metagenomic libraries to enable a quick and efficient screening of nucleotide sequences. Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis. Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group (Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3-4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as Effort-To-Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression-complexity to capture the information content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression-complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nucleotide sequences. We also demonstrate that our proposed method can correctly distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 viruses by analyzing very short segments of nucleotide sequences. This work could be extended further to enable medical practitioners in automatically identifying and characterizing SARS coronavirus strain in a fast and efficient fashion using short and/or incomplete segments of nucleotide sequences. Potentially, the need for sequence assembly can be circumvented.Note The main ideas and results of this research were first presented at the International Conference on Nonlinear Systems and Dynamics (CNSD-2013) held at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, December 12, 2013. In this manuscript, we have extended our preliminary analysis to include SARS-CoV-2 virus as well.},

The multiple alignment strategy does not work for all types of data, e.g. whole genome phylogeny, and the evolutionary models may not always be correct. We propose a new sequence distance measure based on the relative information between the sequences using Lempel–Ziv complexity. The distance matrix thus obtained can be used to construct phylogenetic trees.Results: The proposed approach does not require sequence alignment and is totally automatic. The algorithm has successfully constructed consistent phylogenies for real and simulated data sets.Availability: Available on request from the authors.}",

abstract = "DNA sequences can be treated as finite-length symbol strings over a four-letter alphabet (A, C, T, G). As a universal and computable complexity measure, LZ complexity is valid to describe the complexity of DNA sequences. In this study, a concept of conditional LZ complexity between two sequences is proposed according to the principle of LZ complexity measure. An LZ complexity distance metric between two nonnull sequences is defined by utilizing conditional LZ complexity. Based on LZ complexity distance, a phylogenetic tree of 26 species of placental mammals (Eutheria) with three outgroup species was reconstructed from their complete mitochondrial genomes. On the debate that which two of the three main groups of placental mammals, namely Primates, Ferungulates, and Rodents, are more closely related, the phylogenetic tree reconstructed based on LZ complexity distance supports the suggestion that Primates and Ferungulates are more closely related."

measure and exploits its grouping property: The MI between three
objects X, Y, and Z is equal to the sum of the MI between
X and Y, plus the MI between Z and the combined object
(XY). We use this both in the Shannon (probabilistic) version
of information theory and in the Kolmogorov (algorithmic)
version. We apply our method to the construction of phylogenetic
trees from mitochondrial DNA sequences and to the output of
independent components analysis (ICA) as illustrated with the ECG
